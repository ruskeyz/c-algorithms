# 📝 Algorithms and data structures implemented in C with explanations

## Read makefile

Create c files in src, header files in src, then follow the blank_tests.c for unit testing. Compiles a static library so it is easy to link with unit tests and to the other file programs as needed.

- Default: all
- dev - extra flags
- clean - remove junk

• Header (.h) files for each data structure.
• Implementation (.c) files for the algorithms.
• Unit tests that test all of them to make sure they keep working.
• Documentation  auto-generated from the header files.
